                "We hold each other accountable to deliver our best effort..." - GameChanger Values
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                GameChanger was much more than just an app—it was a pivotal part of my journey. It provided the data I needed to analyze and improve my performance on the field. Here's my story about how GameChanger inspired me to create my own data-driven product, "Baseball Optimus".

        <!-- Product Introduction Section -->
        <section class="product-section">
            <h2>Introducing Baseball Optimus</h2>
                Baseball Optimus began with a request from our coach—to create a system that ensured we always had the best possible team on the field while also balancing fairness. The goal was to optimize competitiveness while giving every player equal opportunities to contribute. This meant managing constraints like equal playing time, allowing kids to try different positions, and leveraging our best pitchers effectively.
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                The solution involves two algorithms working together:
                <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
                <strong>1.</strong> <strong>Batting Lineup Optimization:</strong> By simply texting my server, players and coaches receive a Google Sheet that generates the most optimal batting lineup based on weighted GameChanger stats, including AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS, C%, BA/RISP rank, and QAB%. This lineup is designed to maximize the team's offensive potential.
                <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
                <strong>2.</strong> <strong>Positioning Strategy:</strong> The second algorithm uses custom-made "Madden-style ratings" to assign player positions across all nine innings. These ratings are tailored to account for pitching strength and player skills, ensuring we make strategic decisions that leverage our top pitchers while providing opportunities for everyone to play.
                <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                Together, these two algorithms create an intelligent system that not only optimizes batting performance but also places players in the best possible positions throughout the game. This approach helped us make informed game-time decisions, leading our team to win the league championship.
